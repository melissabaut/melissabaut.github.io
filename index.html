          <div class="para">
            <p class="play-regular">This piece I wrote in my spring semester of 2023. I was nominated by my Composition professor to be published in Rhētorikós: Excellence in Student Writing. Rhētorikós is an online journal of academic composed in Fordham University’s core writing classes (Composition I and II). In this essay, I discuss the barriers introverted personalities face from youth to adulthood and how society disregards these challenges. Attached is a sample of my work that will be published in the Spring Journal of Rhētorikós.</p>
